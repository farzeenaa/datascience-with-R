BatteryI have set automatic heart rate detection turned off and I have set heart rate measurement to improve the sleep accuracy. With these settings,  Battery lasts for a week and a day.  I wouldn't mind recharging the band once a week2. Look and Feel:It looks good  on the hand. Blue strap will be more cooler. It looks decent and elegant with touch screen. The band looks very rigid and durable. The text is not bad. The lift wrist->show time is working with some lag :(3. Accuracy:Heart rate:Heartbeat accuracy seems to be good.Steps:Steps are counted while driving. After 3 hour travel in a bus,  my step count had increased to 3000steps and there is no way to stop this. I am not really satisfied with the step counts.Every day,  I take my bike(motorcycle) for about 70mins driving,  the step counts get increased to about 1000 while I am driving. Even if I use the behavior tagging to say that I am driving,  the step count still increases.I am assuming this will be the common issue across other fitness bands. However,  there should be some option to delete the activity. The accuracy is good with the step count while walking normally.Sleep:I have no idea about the accuracy of sleep tracking. Every day I am seeing different deep sleep and light sleep intervals. It shows the time when I went to sleep and when I woke up with more or less 10mins difference.If I remove the band,  sometimes the band thinks that I have slept and tries to measure the heartrate (since I have set it to improve sleep accuracy in MiFit App). This is little annoying an drains battery a little.4. MI Fit AppThere should be an option to delete wrong step count activities. The app is not easy to use at the first instance but eventually I got used to it. They could simplify the UI a little moreVerdict:For 2000 bucks,  it is really a good option to buy if you don't mind the driving-step count mess up. Look wise it is good. Easy to use and looks durable. You can buy strap alone and use different colored straps to match you style.\\n\\n\",  '\\n\\n  I have been using it for around 50 days now and i would definitely say that its one of the best fitness bands available in the market with this range.Contrary to the popular opinion i find the battery life of this band to be amazing. Its been 17 days since i last charged and there is still 20%battery remaining.People who crib about short battery life are usually the ones who turn everything on all the time such as bluettooth,  notifications etc. However i keep it connected only when i need it and usually its connected to the phone for 2-3 hours daily and with that i have a good battery life.Apart from this,  it is very durable and i have used it in shower,  swimming etc and its completely waterproof.I would definitely suggest to go for it. Its the best available brand in this price segment.P.S. - You dont need to keep every function of this band ON as it results in battery drainage.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  Very bad experience one first day as I charged full battery and by the end of the day says 5% and there is no kind of accuracy\\n\\n',  \"\\n\\n  Despite various positive review on Youtube,  I will not recommend anyone looking for this band.  I am a bit over weight and I love evening walk. On day one i track evening walk,  it was very motivational and on the second day I found the step tracker was very inaccurate. If you are planning to wear it all day and your day include travelling on vehicle,  you will be pissed. I was travelling  on a bus that day,  when I get on that bus my steps were 11446 and when I get off it was 16549.The heart rate tracker,  its very inaccurate too. Surprise?Its a chinese company they will trick you  in any possible way.  Here is my experience:  If you connect your band with the phone and track the walking/jogging via mi fit app(using GPS) the heart rate reading will be above 100bpm but if you do not connect to the app and do the same routine the reading will be below 100bpm. Clearly its a trick to fool us .Battery life is close to 20 days,  I advice you to charge the band to 100% right after unboxing it,  before you turn it on.Screen:  direct sunlight visibility is terrible.Built Quality: If you do not work in a harsh environment they device will survive.  You cannot expect to built like a tank.  But the strap is rigid it will last longer than the band itself.Final thought,  its a waste of money I'd say. You cannot rely on it thought if you are planning to use it for reading notification,  go for it. For 2k,  its okay okay. Do not expect anything from this band. Hold your temptation and buy something worth buying.\\n\\n\",  '\\n\\n  Fully charged Battery drained with in 5 hours and Product packaging already teared up or used product with step count feed.\\n\\n',  \"\\n\\n  It's been 12-13 days since purchase and i find that the battery drains like anything... initially i used to keep the bluetooth on assuming that if will last at last 10-12 (against company's claim of 18-20 days) but it only last 1 day. Then when i switched on bluetooth for minimal time. only to transfer daily band data to phone,  still the band's battery lasts only for 2 days (being modest)I think i have to charge it more often than my phone. :( this is very disappointing.\\n\\n\",  '\\n\\n  Excellent product for the money spent. I was facing problems with the battery for the first week. But i disabled the heart rate detection as per Mi customer support,  and completely discharged and recharged the band. Have not faced battery issues since. But 20 days on a charge sounds like a dream. If you use other features,  it will barely last 2 - 3 days. Hope the review helps other customers.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  Battery drained in one day. Band material is very poor\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  Good product. But disconnects from phone automatically and again you should switch to phone to connect again.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  It is a great product by MI. Battery is great and after using it for 14 days my battery has fallen by 54% only. Make sure you are charging it to 100% before first use. I am really surprised people have got a faulty band with battery issues . You can measure steps,  heart beat and use it for notifications. App by mi is good and helps you track your progress in terms of weight and steps. Overall this is a very useful product and is very premium in terms of touch screen and water resistance.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  The band worked well in the beginning. Battery life sucked because I had kept heart rate monitor on. That was something that I was expecting and was ready for. What I was not ready for,  was the band dying! After using it for about a couple of weeks,  one day it just went dead. There was 10% battery left. I plugged it into the charger and boom! Dead. Now it\\'s not charging,  not responding to anything. Amazon asked me to contact Xiomi because the return window has lapsed. \"Amazon recommends\" doesn\\'t mean much huh?!I tried cleaning the contacts with cotton swab as recorded on the internet. Nothing. I contact Xiaomi support,  they asked me to visit a service centre. Now I have to take time out to take a 2K band to the nearest service centre. I don\\'t know if they will fix it,  replace it or refund me. It doesn\\'t matter. Confidence in the product shaken.You get what you pay for. You buy an el-cheapo band,  you get crap quality. Choose wisely.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  Best budget fitness band. If you are looking for a band,  then this is the best band\\n\\n',  \"\\n\\n  Let's start with the cons. As they're less.- The charging socket... You'll have to carry it with you while traveling coz it doesn't charge up from a regular micro USB or USB C.- The display could have been little brighter for a better outdoor visibility. Don't get me wrong,  it's decently visible in direct sun,  10-15% more brightness would have excellent. Honor Band 4 has a little better brightness with a color display at 600 bucks more.- Heart rate sensor is pretty damn slow and about 5% erroneous compared to Honor Band 4.Let's come to the pros now...+ Exceptional Battery Life... Say if you connect to app for once or twice a day to sync your data,  it lasts for months,  e.g. it's 2 months I am using the Band,  I connect the band once or twice a day while driving and to sync data,  I have charged it twice till date,  once when unboxed and then 3 weeks back from now,  and I am left with 45% juice left... With all-time connection with all features on and heavy workout,  it should last for at last 4 days.+ Fits well.+ Lightweight. You can wear them all day long.+ Strap is sturdy.+ Display is above par than the competition if not as good as Honor Band 4.+ Mi Fit app is pretty good and stable... though it has several areas that can be improved. Fingercrossed as Xiaommi is generally good with updates.\\n\\n\",  '\\n\\n  Was very happy with my purchase until I travelled in an overnight bus yesterday and woke up to a shocker that I had already walked 17000+ steps between 12am - 7pm while I was happily sleeping. Shared this with my brothers who also confirmed it adds a few extra steps when in motion on a bike or car. Not sure how MI is planning to resolve this. Can there be like a flight mode during travel for the band? Just thinking out loud\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  The product shows wrong data about the steps count also the serious issue is battery back up my watch last only for 10 hours and then got drain off. I was very excited to use such watch but now very disappointed for mi band 3. I have send requested for return but they by default put on replacement. I hope i will get my proper band this time or else i just want my refund back.\\n\\n',  '\\n\\n  Had a lot of expectation while uploading from Mi 2 to Mi 3 . But very sad to report that it was not worth it.The battery lasts as long a you just use it to view time and steps. use it a little ore and it drains out in a day or 2. I used it to track y outdoor cycling after connecting it to my mobile. The battery went down from 100 percent to 28 percent in one hour.Its Impossible ( yes ..I wont use the word difficult. Its Impossible) to view the display in sunlight. even if you provide a shade cover with your hands,  its not easy.The touch is not too receptive. Its just average.The only good point is that it looks good and id really waterproof.\\n\\n',  \"\\n\\n  To start with everything MI looks good,  feels good but its definitely not the best. The band is nicely build but however I get the feeling that the screen is a bit too small.  On the battery front,  i 100% charged and started the setup which wasn't any rocket science. You would need to download the MI Fit app from the play or app store,  turn on Bluetooth and follow as you go slong instructions on the app . Once setup,  it will start updating the software which is a bit slow but necessary. Once completed you can start using the band and enabling the various functions appropriate to your liking. The band as claimed is water resistant,  however I'm not too sure so wouldn't risk it.  If you want a mid range tracker that can monitor your workouts,  your walking habbits,  sleeping hours along with other features like missed call notification,  WhatsApp and email notifications and weather etc,  then this is definitely your must buy.\\n\\n\",  \"\\n\\n  Myself and some of my friends purchased this product. But all of us have been facing battery issues. Within an hour of a full charge the battery suddenly goes back to 15%. I can't even return this product back to Amazon.\\n\\n\",  \"\\n\\n  Pros:1. Looks good with curved glass.2. Raise wrist to see time. Shows watch face when you raise your wrist,  works almost all the time. The band needs to be facing you(the device needs to be in vertical orientation) for it to know when you raise your wrist,  it doesn't work if the watch is facing upwards.3. Vibration is strong and works for almost all things that you would want it for.4. Heart rate tracking seems to be quite accurate.5. Battery lasts 15 days for me if heart rate tracking is off. (Can still check heart rate manually) screenshot attached without all day heart rate tracking6. Step tracking is very accurate and very hard to fool. Steps do not increase if you're on a vehicle or by shaking your wrist. Steps are accurate even if you are holding your wrist up(when it is not feeling the jerks from walking).7. Sleep tracking automatically knows when you're sleeping and when you woke up. Also shows how much time of deep sleep you got and how you're doing compared to other users.8. You get app notifications based on apps you've chosen.9. Reminds you to move if you've been idle for an hour. Can be turned off as well.Cons:1. Not enough watch faces. Only 3 basic watch faces,  not customizable.2. Glass is Prone to scratches.3. Wearing the band while sleeping is kind of uncomfortable if you're not used to it,  like most people. But you get used to it after a few days.4. Heart rate tracking has a always on mode where it keeps monitoring heart rate all day,  but this takes a lot of battery and your battery lasts for only 3 days at max.5. band vibrates 2 times for each app notification which is annoying. I prefer to keep it off for whatsapp,  etc.6.  You can't customize which notifications you get from the selected apps. For example,  it is not possible to get only private message notifications but not group notifications from whatsapp.7. Alarms need to be silenced on phone even after it has been silenced on the band.8. Band keeps vibrating even if call has been silenced on the phone.\\n\\n\",  \"\\n\\n  Build quality is ok. Clasp seemed much better than previous gen.But it has been most dissappointing fitness band battety wise. With continous heart rate monitoring,  I was just getting 8 hours of battery life instead of claimed 'upto 2 days'. Continous heart ratre tracking is the reason that I got this band for. It might be giving 14-17 days battery life s well in normal mode ( without continous tracking). But then step and sleep tracking is also adequately done by Mi Band HRX (and you save 1000 rs.) which I own. So it didn't make sense for go for this anymore.Charging takes about 2 hours  from 0 to full.  So all and all I used it for 8 hours and charged it for 2 hours,  twice a day for limited 2 days that I had. Making it unviable option to live with.Add to it Amazon's return policy is fantastic (sarcasm),  because I had to first get a replacment ( which is mandatory no matter whether it doesn't meet the mentioned product specs.) and then return the replacement and wait for 7-8 days or more for refund.But good riddance, ...]\n",
